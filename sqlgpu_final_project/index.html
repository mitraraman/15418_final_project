We met with our TA mentor, Alex, to discuss the details of our project and our possible deliverables. He suggested that we add more complexity to the project as it does not seem challenging enough. We decided to focus on creating a working implementation of SELECT on the GPU before proceeding in order to figure out how doable each operation actually was. We were able to implement SELECT for simple queries on the GPU and found that the operation implementation itself was not very difficult and the performance was much faster than the sequential version on the CPU. However, with the overhead of transferring memory back and forth between the CPU and the GPU, the parallelized GPU version ran at around the same speed as the serialized CPU version with the same level of bandwidth. Now, we are considering:
<ul>
	<li>Ways to lower the overhead or make other operations within the program faster</li>
	<li>Where to store the database and what storage methods will be most realistic</li>
	<li>Whether to implement more difficult SELECT queries and how feasible this will actually be</li>
</ul>
